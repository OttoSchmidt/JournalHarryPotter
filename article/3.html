		<h2>The return of Defense Against Dark Arts at Hogwarts</h2>
		<img src="../gif/3.gif">
		<p>This week, the minister of magic declared that Defense Against the Dark Arts (DCAT) would be returning to Hogwarts, which is a good thing. The Dark Arts, also called Black Magic, refers to any type of magic used to do evil. Then, at DCAT, students learn how to magically defend against Dark Creatures and the Dark Arts. </p>
		<p>An example of mandatory subject content is Wingardium Leviosa, Lumos, Boggarts, Werewolves, Vampires and the Unforgivable Curses (Cruciatus, Imperius and Death). With this, students now have practices to defend themselves from harm.</p>
